'];Project Overview:

•In this project I will be using Pygame to create a Pong game using python. 
•The player will be playing this game with an A. I opponent to score points. 
•Pong is an arcade game to represent the theme of table tennis.
•The game will be a two-dimensional graphic.

Steps I will be taking in this game:

1.Create a game screen.
2.Draw paddles, ball, etc.
3.Ball movement.
4.Create a collision for ball, paddles, game screen and edges.
5.Movement of the player paddle.
6.A.I rival paddle movement.
7.Creating a scoring system for players/rival to score points.
8.Create the loop that handles all code.
9.Game polish.
